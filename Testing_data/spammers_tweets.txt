15977738	10057396968	@jaeblakney Mary, what I mean is deciding primary custody is not an issue 4 your kids. In TX caseworkers & judges frown upon it.	2010-03-05 21:41:07
15977738	10057445260	@jaeblakney Custody must be decided on best interest of the children, not opinions or discussion w/the children.	2010-03-05 21:42:24
15977738	10057502181	@jaeblakney In my experience, parents rarely can have this conversation objectively w/kids, & kids should never be in a position 2 choose.	2010-03-05 21:43:55
15977738	10057784123	@jaeblakney No I'm sorry I disagree, there are decision that are bigger than kids opinions.  There are decision that are adult related.	2010-03-05 21:51:25
15977738	10057834236	@jaeblakney My kids' opinions are:  they should not have to go to school, they could drive by age 8, & candy should be served at every meal.	2010-03-05 21:52:46
15977738	10057889918	@jaeblakney Primary custody, like driving, and education & 100s of other decision must be made by adults.	2010-03-05 21:54:16

15977738	10058351656	@jaeblakney My point is dads come to me saying they have convinced their 8 YO to live w/them.  My response is:  Are u the better parent?	2010-03-05 22:06:25
15977738	10058407990	@jaeblakney Is it in your kids interest that they should live with you?  Would an outside observer justify this change?	2010-03-05 22:07:57
15977738	10058479470	@jaeblakney Most of the time the answers are "No", so I say STOP discussing custody with your 8 YO, it's not to be the focus.	2010-03-05 22:09:55

15980337	899038367	@holly_girl79 yeah true that seem to happen to most people the first few times, you just need to have more lucids and they get longer.	2008-08-26 01:02:02

15980337	2052651337	@Foeminacogitans dreaming power is never lost, only misplaced or ignored for a time.. focus on your desire for it and you might be surprised	2009-06-06 03:29:51

16070198	7453865799	@AfterSparkMedia Awesome! Stay tuned, we're getting closer to releasing Projecturf v2.	2010-01-06 15:12:18
16070198	7909111812	Servers and hardware configs upgraded successfully. Big improvement for scalability and stability, and in prep of v2 in the coming weeks.	2010-01-18 10:21:25

16070198	9243908810	We have introduced folders to the docs section in v2 for better organization. You are now able to add and manage folders independently.	2010-02-17 11:54:43
16070198	9562181978	We updated the download process today fixing some obscure file type errors. Let us know if you have any problems. Read http://bit.ly/baYYU5	2010-02-23 22:58:41
16070198	9562222836	@RonaldYau Yes, if you let the trial expire or have a paid plan and downgrade, you will get the free / limited version.	2010-02-23 22:59:54
16070198	9640159658	We've just designed special print versions of certain pages in Projecturf 2.0, making printing tasks and such easier.	2010-02-25 13:42:31
16070198	11893431837	We finished setting up and testing reply to threads via email, which is amazing and extremely efficient! (part of v2)	2010-04-09 13:02:56

16535009	6157772424	I'll carry the hunting knife, but there is no way that I'm wearing the orange vest.	2009-11-28 20:06:00
16535009	6158761511	@Scaramanga_007 You're probably right.  People would choose to kill a beautiful white buffalo.  I had better kill them first.	2009-11-28 20:48:02
16535009	6329669130	I'm feeling a little down tonight.  Pretty sure that isn't going to go over very well for somebody out there.	2009-12-04 00:27:40

16535009	6445924224	When I'm bored, I pick at my fingernails.  My mother hated that.  One of the many reasons I had to liberate myself as a child.	2009-12-07 17:37:38

16535009	6583222682	I'm looking for a date.  And by date, I mean victim.  And by victim, I mean...well, you know.	2009-12-11 17:56:01
16535009	6583242626	It is so cold outside!  Don't make me wear shoes.  I haven't worn them since...the incident.	2009-12-11 17:56:46

16535009	6641815234	@Scaramanga_007  Put ME off?  You're funny.  When I'm in the mood, you'll find me.  CLUE:  Don't open the door.	2009-12-13 16:25:54
16535009	6641824288	@4everev I never 'bring' the knife.  I ALWAYS have the knife.	2009-12-13 16:26:14
16535009	6641842402	I'm a fixin' to git me some.  That means 'body count = +1.	2009-12-13 16:26:55
16535009	6712880854	I've always wanted a set of warm, fleshy sheets with baby blue eyeballs attached. I think I have a material issue. Flannel's not cutting it.	2009-12-15 18:14:33
16535009	6712991339	@kllyprock You've obviously never tried it my way.  Besides, I don't put off enough body heat to get flannel really cooking.	2009-12-15 18:18:27
16535009	6746284361	@Scaramanga_007  So then, we've found your breaking point.  Good to know.	2009-12-16 17:41:33
16535009	6746299179	These short days are making for some really long nights, and I don't get paid overtime.	2009-12-16 17:42:06
16535009	6746313569	@kllyprock You know, with the skin and the eyeballs and stuff.  Never mind.	2009-12-16 17:42:36
16535009	6795449181	@Scaramanga_007  I don't sulk.  I create sulkers.  What do YOU have to be so happy about?  Whatever it is, it won't last forever.	2009-12-18 07:09:55
16535009	6842752373	I think that I'm being followed by a serial killer.  Best day of my life so far.	2009-12-19 17:21:19
16535009	6967169493	I don't have a Christmas tree and I'm getting ready to sleep on the floor.  I like this time of year.  Except for all the cold and happy.	2009-12-23 09:23:22
16535009	6998901259	Clean up on aisle 9.  I wish.	2009-12-24 07:10:48
16535009	7015631234	@zizanie23  Why would I ruin a perfectly good experience by getting drunk while I do it?	2009-12-24 17:52:39
16535009	7015723940	@Scaramanga_007 Compact knives are for...well...wussies.	2009-12-24 17:56:31
16535009	7015787614	I just stabbed some guy in a red suit. I don't think he'll be missed; there seem to be quite a few just like him.	2009-12-24 17:59:14
16535009	7139593388	I feel bloated from holiday leftovers.  I buried the last of it this morning.	2009-12-28 17:55:53
16535009	7210320519	@Scaramanga_007 I only have to catch you once, you understand that, right?  I don't play any of that Jamie Lee Curtis crap.	2009-12-30 16:02:12
16535009	7210362824	Tonight's going to be a graveyard, and tomorrow night will be a circus. Let's just get on with the 'new' year already. I've got stuff to do.	2009-12-30 16:03:41
16535009	7210421146	I think you should follow these guys: @yngoffendersmed  They might be good for my future.  Or, I might kill them all.  It's up in the air.	2009-12-30 16:05:45
16535009	7252114583	@4everev @BarmaidsBrain  Ladies, wtf?  Intimidated?  Needing YOUR help?  A sport?  ME?  And you wonder why we grow distant.	2009-12-31 17:56:23
16535009	7252139057	Why is everybody so freaking stupid tonight?  There's so much liquor in the air, I'm bringing 2 knives just so they feel something.  Bah!	2009-12-31 17:57:20
16535009	7382254527	Another year, another blood stained carpet.  I'm too young to be stuck in a groove.  Maybe I'll try scissors in 2010.  Or a spoon.	2010-01-04 17:03:54
16535009	7416031240	@mandyprelude122  Did somebody call for a stalker? I usually don't take requests, but what the hell. You look like you'll break easy enough.	2010-01-05 15:29:57
16535009	7416127796	@mandyprelude122  Now I know you're playing.  Anybody that would call me a sissy is clearly self-destructive.  I don't do charity work.	2010-01-05 15:33:19
16535009	7416204383	@mandyprelude122  That would be a step up on your past achievements.  No thanks.  I'll pass.  It's no fun when you see it coming.	2010-01-05 15:36:01
16535009	7416238195	@mandyprelude122 <yawn>	2010-01-05 15:37:12
16535009	7416366479	@mandyprelude122  Oh, you got me.  It hurts.  Oh wait, I just stepped on a tack.  Have fun with your 'bad' self.  I've got people to kill.	2010-01-05 15:41:45
16535009	7457020501	If I were invited on a fishing trip, I'd want to clean all the fish.  (clean=gutting in fish speak, right?)	2010-01-06 16:57:03
16535009	7457350430	Okay, ready to get my murder on.  I'd ask who's with me, but that would involve some sort of a relationship, working or otherwise.	2010-01-06 17:07:22
16535009	7495034126	@sweetnbrunnette  I would love to take credit for your homeliness, but I'm clean.  Try wearing a bag over your head.  Works for me.	2010-01-07 16:41:50
16535009	7495044482	@bitpartdemon  You're right, but I'm not going to high five you.	2010-01-07 16:42:10
16535009	7495104206	I'm trying out some new pickup lines:  "Turn around and don't scream.." "Is that blood on your stomach, or did I not just stab you?"	2010-01-07 16:44:10
16535009	7575051541	I killed a bengals fan. then I killed a jets fan. Only fair, I guess.	2010-01-09 18:40:17
16535009	7635118458	I'm not sure if it's just me, but I can't seem to get warm OR get any sleep, no matter how many bodies I put over me!	2010-01-11 10:44:30
16535009	7648103386	I'm looking for someone with an easy open, resealable...throat?	2010-01-11 17:49:43
16535009	7648488670	@coconicco I don't enjoy the immediate pressure of victimizing. I want to come back and finish if I choose to.	2010-01-11 18:01:32
16535009	7686815583	After a bowl of cereal, I'm off to carve my initials in somebody.  I just love breakfast after dark.	2010-01-12 17:12:49
16535009	7692597539	My heart beats only for you, my love.  Oh wait, that heart isn't mine.  Sorry.	2010-01-12 19:55:09
16535009	7706045954	My mother taught me to put everything back in it's place.  Now the authorities know right where to look! Mom wins again. Time for sleep.	2010-01-13 06:17:15
16535009	7706458918	@zombieowner  I help a lot of people find their hearts.  I have a special shelf in the fridge where I keep them.	2010-01-13 06:34:57
16535009	7706497880	@zombieowner  I haven't been a momma's boy since I buried her in the backyard.	2010-01-13 06:36:35
16535009	7706553607	@xluciferax  You love me?  Have some respect for yourself, please.  Otherwise, the chase isn't any fun.	2010-01-13 06:38:52
16535009	7706605878	@4everev WITH me?  Good luck with that.  I don't do relationships so good.  Go ahead, blame the knife.  How cliche.	2010-01-13 06:41:01
16535009	7706841311	@zombieowner  The only thing I'm trying to make up for is wasted time with heartless people. Dreams are for sissies.	2010-01-13 06:50:33
16535009	7707059356	@zombieowner You know, there's some logic in that. I'll try to remember not to cut off your head if you're using it.	2010-01-13 06:59:11
16535009	7708982325	@zombieowner @bitpartdemon  You obviously don't know anything about my mother: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUEjKyiCVog	2010-01-13 08:07:48
16535009	7724640772	@zombieowner  I've been called 'the gangster of love', but they paid big for that mistake.	2010-01-13 16:33:21
16535009	7724674806	@xluciferax  Now you're talking...	2010-01-13 16:34:23
16535009	7724972928	@zombieowner  You use that word a lot around here.  So did she:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D43uSw9-yv4	2010-01-13 16:43:50
16535009	7725032785	Did you know that a dull knife is infinitely more fun than a sharp one?  And they say that I'm too old to learn.	2010-01-13 16:45:43
16535009	7745389139	Long night and calling it a day.  I'm hoping I don't have any 'Rainbow Bright' nightmares again.	2010-01-14 06:02:49
16535009	7746164141	@zombieowner You're the worst emo goth chick ever.	2010-01-14 06:36:06
16535009	7765590193	The worst part about my 'job' is that I don't get any training.  Or any practice.  It all counts.  Every night feels like finals week.	2010-01-14 17:18:54
16535009	7765831152	@camiOnSpace  I'm an open, complex individual, trapped in the body of a hooded killer.  Now please, lay your head on the table.	2010-01-14 17:26:35
16535009	7765950637	@camiOnSpace  It shouldn't be too long.  You're a quick learner.	2010-01-14 17:30:23
16535009	7785108863	@zombieowner. You should be wondering how to fix that lock on your bedroom window.	2010-01-15 06:01:23
16535009	7785326526	@Scaramanga_007  There are several things that a woman shouldn't fake.  That would be one of them.	2010-01-15 06:10:58
16535009	7785342242	@zombieowner  What can I say?  Your room was a mess.	2010-01-15 06:11:40
16535009	7786040875	@zombieowner. I won't apologize for standards, but you should for not having them.  You WANT to die. Boring.	2010-01-15 06:40:49
16535009	7786498600	@zombieowner  I'm a good American. I believe in free will. And not getting what you want unless you take it. Bed time.	2010-01-15 06:59:13
16535009	7808560028	So if this 'Jimmy' cracks corn, I wonder what I crack?  Deep thoughts for a Friday night.	2010-01-15 18:47:16
16535009	7809079304	I'm so bored, I could make a jigsaw puzzle out of the cashier at the gas station.  Hmmm.	2010-01-15 19:04:13
16535009	7816114099	@zombieowner  Watching you sleep even creeps me out.  Clean your room.	2010-01-15 22:55:58
16535009	7816151733	@Scaramanga_007  Total poseur. Google it.	2010-01-15 22:57:23
16535009	7878702434	i just woke up screaming in a puddle of sweat!  Last time I slaughter a rugby team before bed time.	2010-01-17 16:09:21
16535009	7927690849	@tothechest Your feelings of self-importance are staggering. Thanks for the follow?	2010-01-18 19:50:18
16535009	7965729057	@zombieowner Thats just creepy, watching me while I'm asleep.  Yeesh.	2010-01-19 18:14:01
16535009	7965765159	If happiness is a warm gun, a dripping knife must be euphoria.	2010-01-19 18:15:07
16535009	8052090293	I'm thinking about that one time when I let them live. No I'm not, cuz that would make me crazy. I'm not crazy.	2010-01-21 20:14:44
16535009	8089763404	I want something fresh tonight. A dirty little secret to match my old, rusty knife. A smile to contradict my pain. And some gum.	2010-01-22 17:53:14
16535009	8109701244	I flawlessly executed an entire gang of boisterous bikers last night and NBC still gets the headline for killing Coco. Ridiculous.	2010-01-23 06:51:26
16535009	8176434706	I want to bite off Flavor Flav's head like it was a jaw breaker.	2010-01-24 21:16:23
16535009	8217314121	I keep looking and looking, but nobody really seems worth the risk.  Good thing that doesn't matter. Much.	2010-01-25 20:11:18
16535009	8258005378	As if my life wasn't busy enough, now I'm 'twitter stalking'.  Somebody get me a corpse wanna-be, already.	2010-01-26 18:41:09
16535009	8259206609	Watching 'Corpse Bride' reminds me that even when they're dead, they don't always stay quiet.	2010-01-26 19:15:04
16535009	8260852419	I kept thinking, "why me?", but then I switched it to, "why not you?"  Much better.	2010-01-26 19:59:15
16535009	8316813897	I haven't worn shoes since I was 10, but I'm thinking of trying on a new pair of feet.	2010-01-28 03:36:38
16535009	8342091432	I'm up a little early.  I think I'll grab some breakfast before I grab a little...waitress?  Hello Waffle House!  Keep that coffee black.	2010-01-28 16:57:00
16535009	8342761225	I waive my right to a lawyer. But you can still let me have the lawyer. Alone.	2010-01-28 17:15:41
16535009	8344743917	"My vision is much clearer than my shadow self." Oh Dexter, you slay me.	2010-01-28 18:11:57
16535009	8429201298	@4everev Should I ever develop a heart, it will already be broken thanks to you.	2010-01-30 17:25:35
16535009	8429235762	I have issues with authority, but with the knife, I feel like I'm in charge.  It confuses me.	2010-01-30 17:26:41
16535009	8476755251	It's a night for moving on, so if there's anyone you'd like to say goodbye to, now might be a good time.	2010-01-31 19:48:39
16535009	8496136537	@Scaramanga_007 I'm not going anywhere, that's for sure.	2010-02-01 06:15:57
16535009	8521577630	I've been looking for milk in bones since I was a kid. Urban legend. No cookies either.	2010-02-01 18:51:01
16535009	8523340040	I see sheets of plastic in your future.	2010-02-01 19:47:23
16535009	8584582271	Late to bed and late to rise makes me...want to rip your face off? (I suck at rhymes)	2010-02-03 05:53:05
16535009	8624279493	Sometimes I have trouble 'fitting in'.  Like when he won't 'fit in' the bag unless I cut the limbs off.	2010-02-04 02:03:56
16535009	8651818472	@martianbabe I don't kill animals.  That would just be wrong.	2010-02-04 17:04:18
16535009	8651855074	So I just got served palimony papers?  Seriously?  I've always thought that sex with me would be fatal.  Now the court clerk does too.	2010-02-04 17:05:16
16535009	8652744617	@Wyldekyttin oops?	2010-02-04 17:29:41
16535009	8719404349	@zombieowner  That's because you're doing it wrong. To stalk ME, you just need to turn around. I'm behind you.	2010-02-06 05:49:28
16535009	8750525824	There is just no sport in killing on the weekend. I could use a banana peel on these stupid drunks.	2010-02-06 22:07:47
16535009	8794408410	I answered this guys question with multiple stabbing motions. He asked me, "who dat"?	2010-02-07 21:33:53
16535009	8849891789	It's difficult to hide footprints in the snow.  Winter just isn't my season. (it also makes my skin really dry)	2010-02-09 04:46:28
16535009	8877377286	@Schweefters_pal  I definitely prefer sharp.  I'm not an animal, you know...	2010-02-09 18:01:40
16535009	8877403311	@WotV  You seem to have this whole 'hide your tracks' thing figured out.  Color me unsurprised.	2010-02-09 18:02:19
16535009	8877426384	I'm thinking of turning over a new leaf.  And then stabbing someone with it.	2010-02-09 18:02:55
16535009	8924314765	@Schweefters_pal  Who do I prefer for what?	2010-02-10 17:25:19
16535009	8924330379	@WotV  So you think that I'm a sweet talker?  You should see me dance.	2010-02-10 17:25:43
16535009	8924365887	I try to act all tough and everything, but let me tell you, running around barefoot in February just plain sucks.	2010-02-10 17:26:38
16535009	9029789023	@Schweefters_pal  I like to kill just like this:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHkq94RkEdM	2010-02-12 17:01:50
16535009	9029838402	I really like this whole Follow Friday thing.  It makes my job easier.  All I have to do is turn around, and there you are.	2010-02-12 17:03:11
16535009	9029862426	@zombieowner So weird!  I had a dream that I was standing over you with a huge knife.  What do you think it all means?	2010-02-12 17:03:51
16535009	9029953585	@zombieowner  I already did the sexy clothes thing:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hJ4_DGcwbg  Now let's see that throat of yours...	2010-02-12 17:06:22
16535009	9030013856	@WotV  Pillowshoes.  Ha ha.  I haven't worn shoes since this wonderful day: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUEjKyiCVog	2010-02-12 17:08:05
16535009	9030046266	@zombieowner  *yawn*	2010-02-12 17:09:00
16535009	9091039295	@4everev That's just a cheap knockoff. I carve my cards.	2010-02-14 02:18:33
16535009	9091082871	@WotV Sorry, I've been saving myself for a sweet little sham that only has eye holes for me.	2010-02-14 02:20:26
16535009	9091284542	For the record, you can only be one person's valentine. Otherwise, people get hurt, not that pain is a bad thing. In fact, supersize mine.	2010-02-14 02:29:37
16535009	9091329891	@ZekeMico Dreams only exist to distract you from me. Don't overthink it.	2010-02-14 02:31:31
16535009	9091439156	How is it that I only just now thought of a v-day 2 for 1 special? My marketing skills are feeble at best. Missed slogan? Die hugging.	2010-02-14 02:36:27
16535009	9091477992	@4everev Don't hate yourself because I'm beautiful. Or something like that.	2010-02-14 02:38:19
16535009	9091879735	@4everev Thank you for the reminder. I'd miss that knife. Don't let the violence make you think that I don't appreciate you.	2010-02-14 02:57:23
16535009	9121974238	@WotV There's something about 'knife polishing' that makes me feel funny.  You know, down there...	2010-02-14 20:12:51
16535009	9122005184	@patnelsonchilds That's a hoot.  Or maybe, let me wear your face, Pat?  Yeah, I like that one the best.	2010-02-14 20:13:47
16535009	9122059783	I came home early.  Apparently too many people WANT to die on V-Day.  I don't do charity work.	2010-02-14 20:15:23
16535009	9130635554	@patnelsonchilds That's the difference between us. You do it for the people, I do it for angst. Plus it's fun to put string in the eyeholes.	2010-02-15 00:45:57
16535009	9211745240	I feel a little...lost tonight. (get it?)	2010-02-16 19:19:08
16535009	9262726201	I want to make a hat out of your kidney.	2010-02-17 19:59:58
16535009	9307961533	@4everev A thyroid hat?  How big IS your thyroid?	2010-02-18 17:50:35
16535009	9308007586	I'm trying a new method.  Would anyone care for a Snickers bar?  It's really good and I won't stab you.  Much.	2010-02-18 17:51:39
16535009	9360690892	Call me old school, but I still find a good old fashioned shank to the jugular to be the fastest and most reliable way to exterminate.	2010-02-19 18:39:06
16535009	9521587514	I feel pressure to go 'green', but corpses smell ghastly when they get that color.	2010-02-23 05:20:19
16535009	9600482444	I like to look in the mirror when I'm feeling depressy.  I'm thinking about a blue pillowbag for those rare occasions.	2010-02-24 18:24:35
16535009	9705677415	I'm going to start the weekend off right.  Don't move, I'll be right back.  Really.  Trust me.	2010-02-26 18:58:32
16535009	9851361517	Someone on here blocked me.  No offense, but you weren't my type anyway.  Frightened?  I like.  But rude?  Kill yourself.  I'm out.	2010-03-01 19:08:48
16535009	9903859309	I'm evil incarnate. I should wear something black.	2010-03-02 20:18:00
16535009	10103979676	I'm all out of love, I feel like you dying... (sometimes I really miss Air Supply)	2010-03-06 21:47:14
16535009	10145879263	I'll be killing at the Oscars tonight.	2010-03-07 19:19:40
16535009	10148149046	"I love you more than rainbows." Ha.	2010-03-07 20:06:39
16535009	10151875032	There should be a 'twilight achievement' award, and I should deliver it.	2010-03-07 21:22:57
16535009	10197740651	Death becomes you in so many ways, I can hardly keep up.  But I can keep up with the running just fine.  You'll trip.  They always do.	2010-03-08 19:15:30
16535009	10244462425	Contrary to popular opinion, I don't wear the bag because I'm beautiful underneath.  That is what you're thinking, right?	2010-03-09 17:54:03
16535009	10353866166	@xluciferax Are you working at a fast food restaurant?  I'm a sucker for a burger.	2010-03-11 21:18:13
16535009	10353900090	I thought about having some friends over for dinner, but I don't have any.  I'd probably just kill them anyway, and that's no way to host.	2010-03-11 21:19:02
16535009	10394074424	I can't sleep a wink and it's way too early to start mainlining @tricycles.  What's a guy with a pillow bag over his head to do?	2010-03-12 16:54:40
16535009	10443553657	@Scaramanga_007 That dude looks like Gumby.  But with a better complexion.	2010-03-13 17:33:33
16535009	10443577742	Is there still roller skating?  I'm ready for an old fashioned 'snowball'.  But with my knife.	2010-03-13 17:34:12
16535009	10490937036	Ugh, this headache is killing you! (see what I did there?)	2010-03-14 18:40:43
16535009	10909519836	"All I need is the air that you breathe..."	2010-03-22 23:25:29
16535009	11512074562	<I see...dead people> Is that wrong? Abnormal? Mean?	2010-04-02 21:04:09
16535009	11562055034	The hills are alive. Period.	2010-04-03 20:08:04
16535009	11611754834	Hossenfeffer anyone?	2010-04-04 18:32:51
16535009	11614850045	@Lahrbaby  Achtung. Baby.	2010-04-04 19:43:26
16535009	11688345385	Twinkle, twinkle, little eyeball on my fork...	2010-04-06 03:26:29
16535009	11856866462	Killing away from home is like a traveling road show on HGTV or a Rob Zombie concert circa 1998. I can't decide which for sure.	2010-04-08 21:04:57
16535009	11928037781	I would never bite the hand that feeds me. At least not until I sawed it off.	2010-04-10 03:21:11
16535009	11971259093	"Why are you screaming? I haven't even stabbed you yet."  ha ha, you SLAY me, FK.	2010-04-10 22:24:56
16535009	12021753502	I'm playing a wicked game of 'got your nose' with the neighbor kid.	2010-04-11 20:43:42
16535009	12076955784	I wonder who would live or die if the audience could decide their fates.	2010-04-12 20:07:54
16535009	12193716158	I'm going to have a TV dinner. I hope that something good is on.	2010-04-14 19:38:48
16535009	12260273948	Pulling a dead person's finger yields zero results.	2010-04-15 21:49:38
16535009	12321821871	Anybody got scissors? I need some help with my 'blind side'.	2010-04-16 22:30:29
16535009	12369179398	Brrrr, feels like October out here! I much prefer killing in the summer.	2010-04-17 19:32:05
16535009	12372149318	If I cut Marcia, Marcia, Marcia, would she be Marcia, Marcia, Marcia, Marcia, Marcia, Marcia? You know, if I cut her in two?	2010-04-17 20:41:08
16535009	12427544479	I'm chewing with my mouth open.	2010-04-18 19:48:50
16535009	12488302993	You'd all be much safer if you came in before the street lights came on. Your mom was right. Idiots.	2010-04-19 20:27:02
16535009	12489842713	@linnily I'm always cool after the fear hits home. Thanks.	2010-04-19 20:56:46
16535009	12489902804	@Schweefters_pal  I don't want that at all. Not one little bit.	2010-04-19 20:57:55
16535009	12489979027	@Scaramanga_007  With your tongue out like that, I thought you were trying to French Kiss me. Sick.	2010-04-19 20:59:24
16535009	12547548498	There's this thing I like to do on Tuesday nights. I call it, "Dancing on the Stars."	2010-04-20 19:56:20
16535009	12590467663	Wouldn't it be awesome to make it a whole day without waking up in a cold sweat, dreaming about @zombieowner? I think she drugged me. Again.	2010-04-21 13:14:21
16535009	12607844983	A stitch in time...might keep your spleen from falling out.	2010-04-21 19:32:42
16535009	12672390291	I hate NFL draft day. Not enough cutting.	2010-04-22 19:57:04
16535009	12734999200	I'm tired of beating around the bush. I'm here to CUT you.  Are we clear?  I'm all for optimism, but geez.	2010-04-23 19:59:55
16535009	12735218379	@wiccanz  Gross!	2010-04-23 20:04:13
16535009	12735335816	@wiccanz  That's just too many cooks in the kitchen.	2010-04-23 20:06:36
16535009	12735366771	@wiccanz  You would look awesome in one of my videos though...	2010-04-23 20:07:14
16535009	12735439358	@Scaramanga_007 There IS a lot of cutting on that show. Hmmm. Can I sharpen my knives on your jaw bone?	2010-04-23 20:08:46
16535009	12792694021	"Love your enemy as you love yourself." Ahem. Right over here...	2010-04-24 19:48:19
16535009	12852166958	I'd end you with my teeth, but... You know. The bag. :/	2010-04-25 19:31:15
16535009	12915675466	I dreamt I was 'The Unknown Comic'. I had to take the bag off to check. I'm not, but I could really use a shave.	2010-04-26 19:49:13
16535009	12975417630	I had an idea earlier...a good one...but, I killed it.	2010-04-27 19:33:43
16535009	13038224352	I wish I would've thought to kill my grandmother with a hammer before I left home. Too late now. Oh well.	2010-04-28 19:37:36
16535009	13038324627	@4everev  It's your birthday? Had I known, I'd have offered to cut the cake.	2010-04-28 19:39:30
16535009	13038396941	@msquick1  Crushes can certainly make things easier. For me.	2010-04-28 19:40:52
16535009	13039593050	@msquick1 Yeah, once you get that one leg going...	2010-04-28 20:03:04
16535009	13102793341	@4everev If that's some sort of euphemism, I'm going to be angry and offended.	2010-04-29 20:43:45
16535009	13102926373	I saw an old box of Captain Crunch, so I thought, 'why not?' and stabbed it silly. (one of my favorite 'cereal killer' jokes)	2010-04-29 20:46:24
